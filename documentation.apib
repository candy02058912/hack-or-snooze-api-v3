# Hack or Snooze API

This API is similar to HackerNews. This is a RESTful JSON API with two key resources: **users** and **stories**.
All endpoints require authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), with the exception of reading stories and creating users, which are open to the public.

&nbsp;

---

## Resource Structure

### Collections

The API provides access to the following collections.
Both collections have full CRUD operations.

#### Users

- Collection Endpoint: `/users`
- Singular Endpoint: `/users/{username}`
- Attributes:
  - name
  - username
  - password
  - stories (a list of stories that the user posted)
  - favorites (a list of stories that the user favorited)

#### Stories

- Collection Endpoint: `/stories`
- Singular Endpoint: `/stories/{storyId}`
- Attributes:
  - author
  - title
  - url
  - username (posted by)
  - storyId (autogenerated upon creating a story)

See the [Reference section](/#reference/0/login) for fully-detailed resource documentation.

&nbsp;

---

## Quickstart

&nbsp;

#### 1. First, make a cURL GET request to read stories.

No authentication is required for this endpoint.

&nbsp;

**Request**

`curl -i https://hack-or-snooze.herokuapp.com/stories`

**Response**

```
{
    "updatedAt": "2017-11-09T18:38:39.409Z",
    "createdAt": "2017-11-09T18:38:39.409Z",
    "storyId": "5081e46e-3143-4c0c-bbf4-c22eb11eb3f5",
    "author": "Matt Lane",
    "title": "Do Web Developers Need to be Good at Math?",
    "url": "https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/do-web-developers-need-to-be-good-at-mathm",
    "username": "hueter"
}
```

&nbsp;

#### 2. Next, let's create a user.

No authentication needed yet.

&nbsp;

**Request**

This is a [POST request to /signup](/#reference/0/users/create-a-new-user).

```
curl -i \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"name":"Test User","username":"test","password":"foo"}' \
      https://hack-or-snooze-v2.herokuapp.com/signup
```

**Response**

```
{
    "createdAt": "2017-11-10T21:03:58.358Z",
    "favorites": [],
    "stories": []
    "name": "Test User",
    "username": "test",
    "updatedAt": "2017-11-10T21:03:58.358Z",
}
```

&nbsp;

#### 4. Finally, let's look at our user document 

Using the token, make a GET request to `/users/{username}`.

&nbsp;

Insert the token in all future requests in the auth header like so:
`Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

&nbsp;

**Request**

This is a [GET request to /users/test](/#reference/0/user/get-a-user).

```
curl -i \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
      https://hack-or-snooze.herokuapp.com/users/test
```

**Response**

```
{
    "updatedAt": "2017-11-10T21:03:58.358Z",
    "createdAt": "2017-11-10T21:03:58.358Z",
    "name": "Test User",
    "username": "test",
    "favorites": [],
    "stories": []
}
```
